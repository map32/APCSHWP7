This project seeks to create a game in which the obstacles must be dodged for as long as possible.
It incorporates a variety of objects, such as a plane, a heads-up-display, obstacles, and the environment in which the game is played.

The plane follows the cursor. The world moves with it.


The environment has two types of things,
	Textured hallway
	space with colored cubes(the cubes have no value in life)

There are two types of things that threaten the short-term health of the plane:
	-pillars
	-missiles

Items that benefit the plane:
	-fuel
	-health

(more trivial stuff)
-Start Menu
-Music
-Score-keeping method
-mean-spirited comments that always imply you suck when you lose, 
	you always lose because you can't win this type of game.
	ex: George Washington could have done this better than you, and he's dead.
